# Google_data_analytics_capstone-
I completed this project with the aim of demonstrating the comprehensive skill set I've cultivated through a rigorous six-month data analytics course facilitated by Google experts on Coursera. In the course's duration, I sharpened my data manipulation techniques in R and SQL, mastering the art of extracting, transforming, and analyzing data to derive meaningful insights. 

This project stands as a testament to the culmination of these acquired skills, showcasing my capability to navigate diverse tools and methodologies within the realm of data analytics and visualization.

I hope that work would inspire anyone who interested in data analytics but does not know where to start. Thanks!
